<h2>What is GCS?</h2>
<p>The UK Government Communication Service (GCS) is the professional body for public sector communicators across the UK. It sets the standard for strategic, insight-driven, and measurable government communication ‚Äî and is widely regarded as a world leader in public sector communications practice.</p>
<h2>GCS frameworks</h2>
<p>Comms Assist is based on the successful models developed by GCS, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>OASIS</strong> ‚Äî a framework for campaign planning</li>
<li><strong>MCOM</strong> ‚Äî the Modern Communications Operating Model for building high-performing comms functions</li>
<li><strong>The Evaluation Cycle</strong> ‚Äî six stages to assess communications impact</li>
<li><strong>Behaviour change models</strong> ‚Äî including COM-B and EAST</li>
</ul>
<p>These frameworks are simple, adaptable, and designed for use across teams of all sizes ‚Äî from central departments to regional agencies and ALBs.</p>
<h2>What has GCS achieved?</h2>
<p>The UK model has helped government communicators deliver:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increased citizen trust and engagement</li>
<li>More efficient campaign spend through shared tools and templates</li>
<li>Stronger outcomes, including during crises (COVID-19, cost of living, public health)</li>
<li>Clear evaluation and reporting to show ROI</li>
</ul>
<h2>What does it look like?</h2>
<p>The GCS website is a model of internal government consistency. All communicators are expected to use shared frameworks, follow agreed guidance, and participate in centralised training and evaluation. </p><p></p> Below is a live, useable window showing the GCS home page:</p>

<h2>What we‚Äôve adapted for Tasmania</h2>
<p>This tool brings the best of GCS thinking to a Tasmanian context ‚Äî simplified, localised, and freely available to all government communicators. From campaign templates to cross-agency collaboration, it‚Äôs designed to reduce duplication and help teams do more with less.</p>
