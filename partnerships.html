<h2>Partners and Advocates</h2>
      <p>Partnerships and trusted voices are powerful tools in any campaign. When partners and advocates share your messages, they help cut through noise, expand reach, and build credibility â€” particularly in tight-knit or hard-to-reach communities.</p>
      <h2>What are Partnerships?</h2>
      <p>In communications, partnerships refer to organisations or individuals who can help amplify or co-deliver your messages. This can include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Community groups and local networks</li>
        <li>Influential individuals with lived experience</li>
        <li>Trusted professional associations or peak bodies</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Using Advocates</h2>
      <p>Advocates are third-party messengers who already have trust with your audience. Their support can help validate government action or messaging, especially when scepticism is high.</p>
      <h2>Top Tips</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Identify aligned organisations or individuals early</li>
        <li>Co-create messaging where possible to reflect their voice</li>
        <li>Give clear guidance on timing, visuals and messages</li>
        <li>Make it easy for advocates to support your work (e.g. tiles, packs, quotes)</li>
        <li>Recognise and thank advocates publicly</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Quick Wins with Partnerships</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Use third-party social media pages or newsletters for fast amplification.</li>
        <li>Ask partners to include a quote or foreword in your campaign materials.</li>
        <li>Include partners in your launch or media activities to increase impact.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Planning Partnership Use</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Be clear about what youâ€™re asking from each partner â€“ and what they can expect in return (e.g. recognition, branding).</li>
        <li>Have a central place to track partner use, contact history and response (e.g. CRM or shared spreadsheet).</li>
        <li>Ensure your campaign approvals process includes early agreement to use of partners/advocates if needed.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Supporting Long-Term Partner Relationships</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Build a contact list and track touchpoints â€” donâ€™t just connect during campaigns.</li>
        <li>Keep partners informed with regular updates or annual briefings.</li>
        <li>Showcase impact where theyâ€™ve helped shift awareness or uptake â€” this builds loyalty.</li>
      </ul>
