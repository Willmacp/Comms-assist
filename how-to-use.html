      <h2>How to Use This Tool</h2>
      <div class="text-box">
        <p>This tool is designed to be flexible and lightweight â€” everything is optional and editable. It works best when opened locally in a browser, allowing fast access to campaign guides, templates, and government communication principles.</p>
        <p>Each section represents a key discipline of public sector communication, from strategy and planning to evaluation and media management. You can:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Browse by topic</li>
          <li>Jump into sections you need</li>
          <li>Adapt guidance for your own context</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This tool is best used as a desk reference or team development resource. In future phases, it may also be made available online or as a live resource hub â€” enabling downloads, member submissions, and cross-government collaboration.</p>
