<h2>Stakeholder Engagement</h2>
<p>Engaging stakeholders is a core part of government communications. It means listening, informing, and working collaboratively with those who are affected by or interested in what we do.</p>
<p>This page provides guidance, models and tools to help government communicators in Tasmania work effectively with stakeholders â€” whether communities, industry, NGOs or individuals.</p>
<h2>Core principles</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inclusive:</strong> Stakeholder engagement should reflect the diversity of our community and actively seek out underrepresented voices.</li>
<li><strong>Purposeful:</strong> Engagement should be designed to inform decisions, not just to tick a box.</li>
<li><strong>Transparent:</strong> Stakeholders should understand the role they play and how their input is considered.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Frameworks and references</h2>
<p>In Tasmania, many agencies follow the <a href="https://iap2.org.au/take-iap2-training/" target="_blank">IAP2 spectrum of public participation</a>, especially for major infrastructure or policy work.</p>
<p>This tool also draws on the UK Government Communication Service (GCS) approach to stakeholder mapping and partnership building.</p>

<h2>IAP2 Spectrum</h2>
<p>The IAP2 Spectrum of Public Participation is widely used across Australian governments to define the level of engagement with stakeholders. It helps clarify how much influence the public or a group can have on a decision.</p>
