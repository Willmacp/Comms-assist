  <h2>📌 Key tips for small teams</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Start small and clear.</strong> You don’t need a big campaign — sometimes a timely update is enough.</li>
    <li><strong>Use what already exists.</strong> This site has templates and examples — just adapt them.</li>
    <li><strong>Think audience-first.</strong> Ask: “Who is this for, and what do they need to know?”</li>
    <li><strong>Drop the jargon.</strong> Use plain language, short sentences, and everyday words.</li>
    <li><strong>Ask for help.</strong> Check the Community section or your departmental comms contact.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>✍️ Tone and Style: Writing Plainly and Professionally</h2>
  <p>Clear, consistent writing helps your message land better — even more so if you're working without a comms team.</p>
  <p>We recommend:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Writing in plain English (short sentences, everyday words, no jargon)</li>
    <li>Using an active voice (e.g. “We released the update” not “The update was released”)</li>
    <li>Following a consistent format for punctuation, capitalisation, and numbers</li>
  </ul>
  <p>🔗 For best results, follow the <a href="https://www.stategrowth.tas.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0016/329803/Writing_Style_Guide.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>State Growth Writing Style Guide (PDF)</strong></a>, which outlines how to write in a professional and accessible way for government audiences.</p>
