      <h2>Evaluation in Government Communications</h2>
      <div class="text-box">
        <p>Evaluation is about learning what works. It shows whether communication activities achieved their intended outcomes, and what should be changed or sustained next time. The best evaluation is built in from the start, and is linked to objectives and insight â€” not just an afterthought.</p>
      </div>
   
      <h2>The GCS Evaluation Framework</h2>
      <div class="text-box">
        <p>The UK Government Communication Service (GCS) Evaluation Framework is a six-stage cycle used by departments across the UK and internationally to structure campaign measurement. It aligns well with the OASIS model and gives communicators a clear structure for learning, planning, and improvement.</p>

        </div>
        <p><strong>The six stages are:</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li>Inputs: What resources are you putting in?</li>
          <li>Outputs: Who is seeing it and how?</li>
          <li>Outtakes: What is being understood or retained?</li>
          <li>Outcomes: What has changed as a result?</li>
          <li>Impact: What wider effect has this had on society or policy?</li>
         <li>Learning: What can we do differnrly now, or in the future?</li>

              <h2>International association for the measurement and evaluation of communication - AMEC</h2>
        <div class="text-box">
AMEC is the <a href="https://amecorg.com/">International Association for Measurement and Evaluation of Communication.</a>

It is the worldâ€™s largest media intelligence and insights professional body, representing organisations and practitioners who provide media evaluation and communication research, analysis, evaluation and insights.

We are the founding organisation of the prominently accepted, adopted and applied best practice resources including the Barcelona Principles (1.0,2.0,3.0 and now 4.0) and the Integrated Evaluation Framework and the Measurement Maturity Mapper.

       <p> The GCS Evaluation Framework and theory is closely linked to and based on AMEC <a href="https://amecorg.com/resources/barcelona-principles-4-0/">Barcelona principles</a>, and the latest V4.0 demonstrates what best practice in communication measurement and evaluation should incorporate.

      <h2>Where Evaluation Fits</h2>
      <div class="text-box">
        <p>Evaluation is the final stage of OASIS, and links closely with <a class="assist-button" href="insight.html">Insight</a>, <a class="assist-button" href="strategic.html">Strategy</a>, and <a  class="assist-button" href="campaigns.html">Campaigns</a>. It helps show what worked, what didnâ€™t, and what should be done next time. Evaluation should never be an afterthought â€” building it in from the start saves time, money and effort.</p>
