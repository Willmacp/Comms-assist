<h2>Understanding Insight</h2>
<p>Insight is the foundation of effective communications. It helps communicators understand their audience and how to reach them — through data, research, evaluation and listening.</p>

<p>Insight isn't just about numbers. It's about drawing meaning and understanding from a range of sources, so we can develop communications that are audience-focused, evidence-based, and tailored to need.</p><p>Good communications start with strong insight. That means understanding your audience, their attitudes, needs and behaviours — not just assumptions.</p>
<p>In government comms, this insight could come from research, community feedback, behavioural data, or direct consultation with those most affected.</p>
<p>The goal is simple: know what matters to your audience, and use that understanding to shape meaningful and measurable communication.</p>
