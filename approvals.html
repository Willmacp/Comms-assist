<h2>Why Approvals Matter</h2>
<p>Clear, consistent approvals processes save time, reduce duplication, and improve campaign quality. While Tasmanian Government doesn’t yet have a shared governance model for communications, this section outlines what such a system might look like — and how you can implement smart steps locally.</p>

<h2>Suggested Campaign Sign-off Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Brief approved by Director or ELT-level lead</li>
<li>Planning tools complete (OASIS, narrative, evaluation method)</li>
<li>Risk and stakeholder scan (e.g. checklist or peer review)</li>
<li>Creative checked for accessibility and branding compliance</li>
<li>Implementation calendar approved</li>
</ol>
<p>Use these steps flexibly — the goal is clarity, not complexity.</p>

<h2>What Could a Whole-of-Government Model Look Like?</h2>
<p>Future improvements may include:
      <ul>
<li>A central communications register</li>
<li>Shared assurance panels or peer reviews</li>
<li>Visibility over campaign timing across departments</li>
<li>Standardised metrics and lessons learned</li>
</ul>
<p>This toolkit is a first step toward that goal. Talk to DPAC or your agency’s strategic comms lead if you're keen to shape this.</p>
