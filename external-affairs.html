      <h2>External Affairs</h2>
      <div class="text-box">
        <p>External affairs covers how your agency engages with external organisations, such as business, industry, NGOs, unions, community groups and peak bodies. These stakeholders can be critical influencers or delivery partners and are often affected by policy or service delivery decisions.</p>

        <p>Managing these relationships requires coordination, strategy and a clear understanding of who owns the contact â€” and whether that interaction is reactive or part of a planned partnership or consultation. Comms teams should work closely with policy, engagement and ministerial staff to support the right approach and to avoid duplication.</p>
