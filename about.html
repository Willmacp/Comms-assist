<h2>What is Comms Assist?</h2>
<p><strong>Comms Assist</strong> is a toolkit for Tasmanian Government communicators. It brings together proven guidance, templates, frameworks, and reference materials to help public sector communications teams plan, deliver, and evaluate their work more effectively.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>How it was built</h2>
<p>This version was developed in 2025 by <strong>Will Charlton</strong>, Strategic Comms Manager at Macquarie Point Development Corporation (MPDC). It draws on Willâ€™s experience establishing and leading local communications teams and new appraoches for GCS in the UK Prime Ministerâ€™s Office and Cabinet Office, and builds on some of the original GCS frameworks he helped design.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Whatâ€™s included</h2>
<p>Each section of the tool reflects a core function of effective public sector communications â€” including Campaigns, Insight, Strategic Planning, Evaluation, Branding, Stakeholder Engagement, and more.</p>
<p>Where possible, it links back to original UK GCS guidance and adds Tasmanian-specific materials and examples.</p>
