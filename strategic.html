      <h2>Strategic Communications Overview</h2>
      <div class="text-box">
        <p>Strategic communication is the deliberate use of communication to advance organisational objectives. In government, this means providing timely, accurate and consistent information that supports policy, earns trust, and delivers measurable public value.</p>
        <p>It involves identifying the right objectives, shaping the narrative, understanding audiences, and aligning all communication efforts ‚Äî from campaigns to stakeholder engagement ‚Äî to common goals. Strategic communication also ensures the right governance, roles and skills are in place to deliver this work effectively across departments.</p>
        <p>Strategic communications in the public sector are not about short-term awareness alone ‚Äî they help shape policy outcomes, anticipate risks, and support long-term behaviour and social change.</p>

      <h2>The Four Core Functions of Strategic Communications</h2>
      <div class="text-box">
        <p>Strategic communications within government are guided by four core functions. Together, they provide a consistent and effective model for designing and delivering purposeful communication:</p>
        <ul style="list-style: none; padding-left: 0;">
          <li style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
            <strong>üîç Insight:</strong> Understand your audiences, channels and context. This involves gathering data, conducting research and identifying behavioural drivers that inform planning.
          </li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
            <strong>üí° Ideas:</strong> Shape strategies that align to organisational goals. Ideas turn insight into action, guiding the development of clear objectives, messages and engagement plans.
          </li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
            <strong>üõ†Ô∏è Implementation:</strong> Deliver through the right mix of channels, tactics and timing. Implementation involves good governance, skilled delivery and collaboration across teams.
          </li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
            <strong>üìä Impact:</strong> Evaluate outcomes against objectives. Impact measurement helps you learn what worked, demonstrate value, and adjust your approach over time.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>These four functions form the basis of the <a href="mcom.html">Modern Communications Operating Model (MCOM)</a> and are embedded throughout the Comms Assist toolkit.</p>
