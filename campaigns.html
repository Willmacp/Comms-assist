<h2>Campaigns Overview</h2>
      <h2>Plan, Deliver and Evaluate with OASIS</h2>
      <div class="text-box">
        <p>The OASIS framework is a structured model for campaign planning and delivery. Developed by the UK Government Communication Service (GCS), it helps communicators define clear outcomes, use insight effectively, and ensure delivery aligns with strategic priorities.</p>
        <hr/>
        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>What are you trying to achieve? Set specific, measurable outcomes that link back to your department or program goals. A good objective is outcome-focused (not just outputs) and framed in a way that evaluation can prove success or progress.</p>
        <h3>Audience Insight</h3>
        <p>Who do you need to reach and what matters to them? Use research, data and behavioural insight to understand your audiences â€” including their values, media habits, and barriers to action. This ensures relevance and sharpens your strategy.</p>
        <h3>Strategy / Idea</h3>
        <p>Whatâ€™s your big idea? How will you deliver the right message, through the right messenger, at the right time? Your strategy should summarise the core approach, include your creative platform or theme, and align with other government activity or policy levers.</p>
        <h3>Implementation</h3>
        <p>How will the campaign roll out? This step covers your activity schedule, media and channel mix, partnerships, and governance arrangements. Include timings, responsibilities and a risk plan â€” especially for multi-agency work or high-risk topics.</p>
        <h3>Scoring / Evaluation</h3>
        <p>How will success be measured? Link your evaluation directly to the objectives. Use benchmarks and KPIs to assess reach, engagement, behavioural change, or perception shifts. Include a mix of qualitative and quantitative data â€” and report both results and lessons learned.</p>
