<h2>What is MCOM?</h2>
<p>The Modern Communications Operating Model (MCOM) is a framework developed by the UK Government Communication Service (GCS) to help structure and manage communications functions within government. It is used to build high-performing teams and drive better public outcomes through strategic communications.</p>
<p>This version has been adapted to suit the Tasmanian Government context, supporting whole-of-government collaboration, improved standards, and consistent delivery across departments and agencies.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Key Principles</h2>
<ul>
<li>All comms teams are strategic, insight-driven and audience-focused</li>
<li>Shared capabilities enable efficiency and skill-sharing across government</li>
<li>Professional development and evaluation are core parts of the model</li>
<li>Modern tools and data should underpin planning and delivery</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Using MCOM in Tasmania</h2>
<p>DPAC and agency leads are encouraged to use MCOM to assess strengths and gaps in their communications function â€” and to help create a shared roadmap for capability uplift across government.</p>
<p>While MCOM is not mandatory in Tasmania, it provides a powerful framework to modernise communications and embed the same high standards seen across the UK and internationally.</p>

<h2>The 7 Pillars of MCOM</h2>
<p>MCOM is structured around seven functional areas that support effective public sector communication. These pillars help ensure teams are well-equipped, strategic, and aligned:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="campaigns.html">Campaigns and Marketing</a> â€“ Delivering audience-first campaigns that drive behaviour or perception change</li>
<li><a href="media-and-external-affairs.html">Media and External Affairs</a> â€“ Engaging with media and public audiences to shape understanding</li>
<li><a href="internal.html">Internal Communications</a> â€“ Keeping staff informed, engaged, and aligned with organisational goals</li>
<li><a href="insight.html">Insight</a> â€“ Using research and data to inform all communications activity</li>
<li><a href="digital.html">Digital Communication</a> â€“ Reaching people through online channels in accessible, timely, and engaging ways</li>
<li><a href="evaluation.html">Evaluation</a> â€“ Measuring outcomes and improving performance over time</li>
<li><a href="branding.html">Branding and Identity</a> â€“ Maintaining a unified and professional visual presence for government work</li>
</ul>
